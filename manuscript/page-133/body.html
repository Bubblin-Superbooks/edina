"He came home here about seven o'clock, or between that and half-past—I can't be sure as to the exact time. I thought he had come for good; he was three-parts tipsy then, and I advised him to sit down and make himself comfortable. Not a bit would he heed.

Of course he was going back to the Golden Shaft. There can't be a doubt of it."</p></div> </div>
