And there, what with agitation and nervous fear, the bride burst into a fit of hysterical tears.</p><p>"Daisy! For goodness' sake!—not here. Compose yourself, my love.

A dread of its being interrupted, a nervous terror at what she was doing, held possession of her. Now that it was over, she saw she had done wrong, and wished it undone. Just like all the rest of us! We do wrong first, and bewail it afterwards.</p><p>"You remain in here, please, Frank; let me go out alone," she said, catching her breath. "It would not do, you know, for us to go out together, lest we might be seen. Good-bye," she added, timidly holding up her hand.</p></div> </div>
