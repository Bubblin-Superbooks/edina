"Why should you call him an idiot, Mr. Frank?"</p><p>"He must be one, if he thinks he can persuade Rosaline to like him. See how ugly he is!"</p><p>"She might do worse, sir.

Blase Pellet is putting by money: he will be setting up for himself, some day; and he would make her a good husband."</p><p>"Do you tell your daughter that he would?" asked Frank.</p><p>"She won't let me tell her, sir. I say to her sometimes that she seems frightened at hearing the young man's very name mentioned: just as though it would bring some evil upon her. I know what I think."</p></div> </div>
