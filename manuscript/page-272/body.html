The major liked to lie in bed rather late in a morning; which was not good for him. But for his indolent habits, he need not have been quite so stout as he was. Frank Raynor glanced at the bureau, opposite to him as he sat, and wondered whether his uncle had recollected more about the one desired item of the will within it during his sleep.</p><p>"Has Uncle Francis had a good night, aunt?" asked Frank, who was inwardly just as impatient as he could be for news, and perhaps thought he might gather some idea by the question.</p><p>"My dear, he always sleeps well," said Mrs. Raynor. "<em>Too</em> well, I think. It is not good for a man of his age."</p><p>"How can a man sleep too well, mamma?" cried one of the children.</p><p>"Well, my darling, I judge by the snoring. Poor papa snores dreadfully in his sleep."</p></div> </div>
