"Mrs. Preen is about to stay for a time in Devonshire, as perhaps you know, and the little girls are to go to school. So I am no longer wanted here."</p><p>"I should consider that a subject for laughter instead of tears. You will be spared work."</p><p>"Ah, you don't know," cried Alice, her tone one of pain.

And the next place I get may be harder than this."</p><p>"And you were crying at the anticipation?"</p><p>"No. I was crying at the thought of perhaps not being able speedily to find another situation.

And I think you will be just the right person to fill it."</p></div> </div>
