He was on horseback; riding along very leisurely.</p><p>"Good-day," said he, nodding to her in passing.

She heve gone to her aunt's to forget it."</p><p>"Oh, to be sure," carelessly assented Frank: and rode on.</p><p>A few minutes afterwards, when near Trennach, he met Mrs. St. Clare's carriage; herself, two ladies, and Lydia seated within it.
